# brainfuck
This is a brainfuck interpreter written in C. it is far from complete, but I've got *something* working, so I might as well upload it. My first project in C ever, besides a small program I wrote to find anti-prime numbers.

## what doesn't work:
* input from files (low priority)
* some programs for some reason (see hello world from [here](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a)).
* errors n' stuff.
