# brainfuck
This is a brainfuck interpreter written in C. it is far from complete, but I've got *something* working, so I might as well upload it. 
I support the basic 8 instructions, and writing a comment using '#', which will last to the end of the line.



## what doesn't work:
* errors n' stuff (add in a non-minimal compiling option).
