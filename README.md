# brainfuck
This is a brainfuck interpreter written in C. it is far from complete, but I've got *something* working, so I might as well upload it. My first project in C ever, besides a small program I wrote to find anti-prime numbers.

## what doesn't work:
* errors n' stuff (add in a non-minimal compiling option).
